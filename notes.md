# Scratch Note Area

this is amounts of red, blue, and yellow isn't it. probably in the order of red
/ yellow / blue since 100 / 100 gives me purple. 100 gives me dark crimson red.
I want lighter though. higher numbers gives me lighter, lower darker.
interesting. aha 200 gives me what I want. oh interesting! I've heard of RGB
before. So middle is green. I think i've heard about bs with yellow and PCs
before. So I'd need to do probably...hmm, not sure how I'd get to yellow.
Probably fuck with it. pretty sure I'm right about the third being blue tho. yea
i am self challenge time - achieve yellow 175, 150, 50 gives me a dark pee
yellow color. I want bright yellow though, like primary school yellow 225, 175,
75 is like a yellow orange mix. 225, 175, 100 is like a light orange. 225, 175,
25 is closer! Lighter yellow. 250, 175, 0 is too close to just an orange color
even though it's brighter. 250, 250, 0 gives my bright yellow. Excellent.
